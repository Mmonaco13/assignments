                <h2>Signing up for the US Army</h2>
                <p>After I graduated from College, I didn't really have a plan. A man convinced me to enlist for the United States Army. It was on the way to camp that I met my friend Bubba. Bubba loved talking about shrimp. He told me about all the different ways you can cook shrimp. He told me how he plans on buying a shrimp boat and I thought it was such a great idea that I wanted to join him.</p>

                <h2>Basic Training</h2>
                <p>Training was not too hard. We had to scrub the floor with toothbrushes, but it wasnt too bad. One of the drill sergants was very impressed with how fast I assembled my rifle. I was able to go back home after training. I told my friend Jenny that I was being deployed to Vietnam. She didnt seem to happy, and told me to not be brave.</p>

                <h2>Vietnam</h2>
                <p>In Vietnam, Bubba and I were in the same infantry division. This is where I met my friend Lieutenant Dan. One day, we got ambushed. I was told to retreat but I got lost. When I couldn't find Bubba, I got scared that he was hurt. I saved a few other soldiers but I was too late to help Bubba. After the ambush, I realized that I was shot in the buttocks and eventually got sent home.</p>
