                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>My name is Forrest Gump. I was born on June 6, 1944 in Greenbow, Alabama. When I was young, I had to wear braces on my legs because my spine was crooked. My dad went on vacation when I was young so it was just me and my mom. My best friend is Jenny Curran. Ive been in the US army, played professional ping pong, started Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, and made a lot of money by investing in some fruit company called Apple. Currently, I an still living in Greenbow Alabama with my son, Forrest Gump Jr.</p>
